        We first met in November 2022 at a TLC Vibe Christian youth group. I didn‚Äôt recognize him at the time, though I thought he was cute. Six months later, on my birthday, May 8th, after church in Canary Wharf, he tapped my shoulder and said, ‚ÄúI think I know you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt remember him, but as we talked, I realized we both worked in tech. I asked for his Instagram to stay connected, and it clicked‚ÄîI had ignored his profile request months earlier. üò≤
        </p>
        <p>
        He started commenting on my book reviews online, which I thought was cute and showed interest in reading. ü•∞ He kept finding reasons to talk to me and eventually asked me out. I said no initially, as I wanted to get to know him better first. We had long phone conversations about our values and ambitions, discovering many similarities. üòÑ
        </p>
        <p>
        After two months, I invited him to a friend‚Äôs BBQ, and we had great vibes. üéâ I knew he could be the one. He then asked me on a date, and I said yes. We went for sushi, and I admired his eagerness to try new things. üç£
        </p>
        <p>
        On another date, he cooked for me at his flat‚Äînumber 29. Coincidentally, I was buying my first flat, also number 29! üò± We continued dating, prayed for confirmation, and realised that the period I began praying for my husband in 2021 was the same time he left Nigeria for London. We‚Äôre grateful for the confirmation we received. üôè

          Our love story began when we met through a mutual friend at Vibe, TLC&apos;s young adult church meeting. However, it didn&apos;t really take off until six months later when I approached her after a church service and got her Instagram. I slid into her dms by making small comments on her stories, which eventually led to our first call. That call lasted about two hours, during which we talked about our backgrounds, families, faith, and values. I knew she was the one from that conversation, but I needed to be careful and pray about it.After a few dates, we grew even closer, and I discovered what a beautiful, loving, and kind person she is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following a couple of confirmations from God, we started dating and have been growing stronger ever since.
